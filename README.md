### Background 
This project is a python, text based Quiz program for INFO-students of UiB.
I wrote this while studying Informational Science as an attempt to make my learning process a little more effective by letting AI exctract the most important stuff from the lectures, then practice it.
I also had a lot of fun and as one of my first coding project, i learned a lot.

The quizes that are made are based on the lectures provided by the professors at the university. The quizzes are AI-generated.

### Features:
* A text-based menu interface
* quizzes sorted on course and subsorted by lecture content
* Keep track of correct or wrong answers
* After the quiz the program let you practice the answers answered wrong
